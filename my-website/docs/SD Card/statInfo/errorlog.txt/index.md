# errorlog.txt

Houses all errors that the Arduino accumulates over runtime. Creates a new line
for each new error, and includes:

* Date and Time of occurrence
* Log level (error, warning, notice, debug)
* Error code if applicable that may lead to more info on the issue
* Simple message describing what happened
